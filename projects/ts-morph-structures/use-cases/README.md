# Use cases

The files in this directory are demonstrations of `ts-morph-structures` and `ts-morph` in action.  These are not test cases.  The formal testing is over at this point.

Instead, I'm going to focus on how to use these libraries to generate TypeScript code.

As a result, you'll see a lot of console logging when you run this "stage".  You'll also see greater numbers of code comments than usual (or at least, I hope so).
